create a script to brute force a force digit pin (loop through 0-9999). then use nc to send the password
for bandit 24, a whitespace char, and the four digit pin in each iteration of the loop. you can capture the output of the 
nc listener in port 30002 or you can just wait and hope you see the output of the correct pin.
